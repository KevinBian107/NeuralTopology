# NeuralTopology
This is a MVP repository for trying to understand what's truely happening inside the weight space of neural network when they are training upon specific tasks. Particularly, this will develope into seeing how the VNL system from [Talmo's lab](https://talmolab.org/) at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies may evolve different topological characteristics across DRL training.

## Expected Outcome üß™
1. Helping us to better understand what is truly happening inside neural network
2. Providing another metric of comparing with experimental neuronal data (~homeomorphic).

## Preliminary üìù
Examining the training of an mujoco hopper agent. We can see the saturation of represenation as training progresses:

The training runs and topological characteristic changes over time are also captured in this [wandb training log](https://wandb.ai/kaiwenbian107/hopper_ppo_topology_analysis?nw=nwuserkaiwenbian107)
